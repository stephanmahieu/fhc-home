In Firefox up to version 57 the internal persistent data store was based on SQLite, starting with Firefox version 57 that data store is no longer accessible for add-ons (neither directly nor via the API), storage facilities for add-ons are now based on IndexedDB. In order to get the formhistory data from old Firefox versions and make it available for the Form History Control plugin in newer versions, I developed a standalone application that can read from the SQLite database and create an exportfile that can be imported by the Form History Plugin into the new data store. Requirements \u00b6 This application can be used on any platform for which a Java runtime is available. It requires a Java runtime of at least version 1.8. You can check if you already have a Java runtime installed by executing the following command from the commandline: java -version If this command is not recognized you most likely have no Java runtime installed. You can find instructions on how to download and install Java from http://java.com/nl/download/ or use a package manager provided by your OS. Download the export application \u00b6 Download the java application fhcExport-1.0.0.jar from github here: fhcExport-1.0.0.jar . Put this file in any directory you like, then open a dosbox or a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file. Start the application from the commandline using the -jar option (see the Usage section). Usage \u00b6 Exporting data from Firefox's internal formhistory store \u00b6 From the command-line you start this java application using the following command: java -jar fhcExport-1.0.0.jar That should display a little help text because you have to add at least one parameter: -h,--help show help. -o,--outputfile <arg> optional, the path of the outputfile (default:formhistory.xml in current directory) -p,--profile-dir <arg> required, the Firefox profile directory. The application needs to know where to find the Firefox database so you have to provide the Firefox profile directory. How to find the profile directory is described on this mozilla.org support page For example the profile directory can be something like: C:\\Users\\John\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\jguiwjin.default if you have a Windows OS. If you know the profile directory you can start the java application and try to export the formhistory data. Execute the application with your profile directory as parameter: java -jar fhcExport-1.0.0.jar -p C:\\Users\\John\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\jguiwjin.default If everything runs smoothly you should see something like: Start formhistory export - profile directory: C:\\Users\\John\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\jguiwjin.default/ - destination file : formhistory.xml checking outputfile: OK checking profile directory: OK reading inputfields: 2230 reading multilinefields: 441 writing data: OK You should now have an exportfile named formhistory.xml that you can use to import into the new add-on. The 'reading multilinefields' step might fail, this is completely normal if you never used this add-on before. The export will still contain the formhistory for all standard text inputfields Firefox normally stores in its internal database. Importing the formhistory xml file: \u00b6 open the Form History Control add-on in Firefox (right-click on the Form History Control icon, choose the first menu item) From the dialog you just opened, choose File from the Menu on top, then choose Import: the import dialog will open Locate and select the formhistory.xml file you exported previously Selecting the xml exportfile will enable the Import button, click this button to start the actual Import","title":"FHC Export"},{"location":"FHCExport/#form-history-export","text":"This ia a standalone Java application for exporting formhistory from Mozilla's (Firefox) SQLite database.

Dialogs not showing content \u00b6 There is an annoying bug in Firefox for Linux users which causes the popup window to come up blank most of the time. bugzilla: issue 1425829 New popup window appears blank until right-click bugzilla: issue 1416505 WebExtensions popup blank Workaround is to right-click inside the window or resize it. Hopefully this bug will be fixed soon. Progress spinner never stops spinning \u00b6 While opening the popdown dialog (left-click), the progress spinner sometimes never stop spinning. The amount of resources available for a popdown (left-click) dialog is limited by the browser. When there is too much data to display, the applications runs silently out of resources. The total amount of data that can be displayed by the popdown dialog without a problem lies around 2500 items depending on the available resources of the underlying system. To fix the problem open the main dialog instead (right-click, choose first menu item). The main dialog is not affected by the resource limitation and will always show all available formhistory data. You can now delete some of your older entries to reduce the amount of data. This issue is fixed in release 2.1.0.0 which will automatically limit the amount of data displayed by the popdown dialog as well as the amount of time it may take and show a warning message when data was discarded from the view. The new version will also provide the ability to automatically cleanup history to prevent this kind of problem to occur. Storage (IndexedDB) Error \u00b6 IndexedDB error occurs for the following reasons. Cookies are disabled Firefox setting is set not to remember history IndexedDB is not enabled in about:config Corrupted file exists in firefox's storage If any of these apply, IndexedDB can not be used. Cookies not enabled \u00b6 A firefox bug prevents an add-on to access the internal storage when cookies are disabled. Until this bug is fixed it is necessary to enable cookies in order for this add-on to be granted access to internal storage. To enable cookies open Privacy & Security of Firefox settings, it is necessary to enable: Accept cookies and site data from websites (recommended) Firefox setting is set not to remember the history \u00b6 Please confirm that firefox setting is set to remember history. Open Privacy & Security of firefox settings, it is necessary to set History as follows: Firefox will: Remember history or Firefox will: Use custom settings for history [X] Remember my browsing and download history [X] Remember search and form history IndexedDB is not enabled in about:config \u00b6 Please access about:config and confirm that the value of dom.indexedDB.enabled is true. If false, change it to true and restart firefox. Corrupted file exists in firefox's storage \u00b6 The cause of corruption generally fall under one of the following reasons (see bugzilla 944918 ): running some cleaning or optimizing software, for example CCleaner, BleachBit, Wise Disc Cleaner, ZHP Cleaner, Wisecleaner. Regarding popular CCleaner, reported versions were quite old: 5.03.5128 and 5.28. running some special (less known) anti-virus or anti-malware software, like Malwarebytes or SUPERAntiSpyware. However only very few people reported this and was not able to reproduce it (but it may be related to data stored in the db, like some URL that is flagged as malware...). downgrading your Firefox profile - if you execute any Firefox older than 57, then your profile gets instantly corrupted! This is often the reason - users using 56 or ESR versions decides to upgrade to 57+, they see half of their add-ons doesn't exists anymore, so they downgrade back and BAM! Database corrupted. there are some rare cases when profile gets corrupted during the Firefox upgrade. few people reported that only database of my add-on was corrupted and other add-ons / pages using IndexedDB were still working (I'm testing this on this page (db log is in bottom left corner): http://mdn.github.io/to-do-notifications/) Regarding fixing it, if only one database is corrupted, then you may need to just remove specific database (dropping DB using API will fail, so you need to do it manually on your hard drive in profile\\storage\\default\\ ). If your whole IndexedDB engine is corrupted, the only option may be resetting your profile (consider setup Firefox Sync. before). For information on fixing a corrupted profile see this article by sienori, developer of the Tab-Session-Manager add-on.

Download the add-on \u00b6 First download the source code of the add-on to a location of your choosing. You can download the latest version from github.com and use the green \"Clone or Download\" button. Either use a git client (if you have that installed and know how to use it) or just simply download the zipfile and unpack it. Install and change language (Firefox) \u00b6 If you want to test your translation, you can do so in a separate Firefox profile. See support.mozilla.org on how to create an extra profile. Within this profile you can load the add-on version you downloaded in the first step. Install the downloaded add-on by entering \" about:debugging \" in the URL bar and then click \" Load Temporary Add-on \". Choose the \"manifest.json\" file of the add-on you downloaded in the first step (see also this mozilla webpage for detailed instructions). The add-on is now installed and available in your profile. If you exit Firefox the add-on will not be available if you start Firefox again, you have to load the temporary add-on again. The data will remain available if you exit Firefox, only when the add-on is removed using the \"about:debugging\" page, data will be removed as well. If you are using an international version of Firefox, it may very well be that you are not seeing the desired translation but the (default) english translation instead. In that case you can switch the default language by entering \"about:config\" in the URL bar, search for \"general.useragent.locale\" , and set the value to the tag for the desired language, for example \"de\" for German. You may also have to change the intl.locale.requested property accordingly. In some cases switching the locale does not work for whatever reason but it probably has something to do with not being able to display international characters. If switching the language does not work you are probably using an international version, in that case download and install a Language specific version of Firefox. If you made changes in one of the language specific files you may have to reload the add-on (on the about:debugging page) in order to see the changes. Install and change language(Chrome) \u00b6 If you want to test your translation, you can do so in a separate user profile. See Google Chrome Help on how to create an extra profile (people). To load the Form History Control extension use the More tools option from the settings menu by clicking the tiny dots (or bars, in some cases) in the top right next to the URL bar.

To see the details in a separate window double-click the item, a View Entry dialog will open. See the popdown in action! The main dialog \u00b6 Open the main dialog by right-clicking on Form History Control toolbar icon. The main Dialog provides access to all available features. In addition to the limited popdown dialog it has an extra menu-bar on top giving access to additional features. The main dialog also allows you to perform operations on multiple selected items at once. Right-clicking on a list item opens a context-menu which allows you to perform some operations on the clicked item only. In order to perform an action on multiple selected items at once choose the desired operation from the edit-menu in the menubar on top. The searchbox on top will let you filter the list on any fieldname, value, type or URL. You can search on multiple keywords by separating them with a space.

It is also possible to add a complete new item. See the Main dialog in action! Context menu \u00b6 When Form History Control is installed, you can right-click in the browser window to bring up the context menu. At the bottom of the context menu a Form History Control submenu will be present, from this submenu you can open the Main Form History Control dialog (first menu item), Restore/Fill form fields in the current displayed webpage and more. See the context menu in action! Page menu \u00b6 Firefox only! When Form History Control is installed, the address bar of the browser will show a black and white Form History Control icon from which the context-menu (right click) or the page-menu (left click) can be opened. The page-menu provides quick access to the main dialog as well as the possibility to instantly blacklist the current page (if enabled in preferences) or toggle the textfield information for the current page. See the page menu in action! Preferences \u00b6 Use the preferences window to manage various options that alter the behaviour of the Form History Control plugin. Note that there is an advanced options checkbox that unlocks additional settings. There are multiple ways to open the preferences dialog: Right-click on the FHC toolbar icon will show a context menu, under submenu 'more..' you find a preferences options. From the main dialog or thge popdown dialog, the little cog icon on the top right hand corner will also open the preferences dialog. Opening the add-ons page from the browser menu will show all installed add-ons, on the right-side of Form History Control there is a Preferences button that will also show the preferences but in a browser window instead of a separate dialog Miscellaneous \u00b6 Override Autocomplete You can choose to override the built-in autocomplete feature. This option disables the browser built-in autocomplete dropdown-lists and the browser formhistory datastore and replaces it with the add-on's version. When override is enabled the autocomplete dropdown lists are generated by the Form History Control add-on using the formhistory exclusively maintained by this add-on. Multiline field version Use these settings to control for multiline editor fields whether a new form history entry should de added or the last entry should be updated. Keyboard \u00b6 Shortcut keys can be assigned to a variety of actions (Google Chrome allows at most 4). You can for example assign a shortcut key combination to open the Form History Dialog or directly perform an action like filling all fields with the most recent entries. In order to assign a new key combination to an action click the Modify button (yet only available on Firefox). The checkbox controls whether the shortcut key is active (checked) or disabled (unchecked). The first modifier key and the last key is mandatory, the second modifier key is optional. From Firefox versions \u2265 63 all keys become available for the second modifier, earlier version only support the Shift key. It is possible that a key combination is already assigned to another add-on or is in use by the browser itself. This extension can not detect this situation and it is very likely that another action will be executed instead. If that is the case simply choose another key combination. Clean-up \u00b6 Automatic cleanup will periodically (every 15 minutes) remove entries from the formhistory storage if older than the set number of days. It is recommended that you enable this option. If the storage contains a very large number of entries the add-on can become sluggish (particularly the popdown dialog will be affected). Depending on the resources of the underlying system try to keep the number of entries below 2500. Domain Filter \u00b6 If Allow All is enabled (the default), the Form History Control add-on will remember form history for all pages. To prevent storing history for specific pages you can either blacklist the domains for sites you wish to exclude or whitelist the domains of sites you do wish to remember. If either the blacklist or whitelist option is enabled the Form History Control icon in the toolbar will reflect the current state of saving allowed (green + sign) or saving disallowed (red - sign). See the Domain Filter in action Field Filter \u00b6 To prevent storing formhistory for certain fields add the name of the field to the Field Filter list. Standard password type fields are never stored and do not have to be added here. The field exclusion list is not used during the cleanup process. Themes \u00b6 In the Display options the theme selector allows you to choose a color theme for the Form Histor6y Control. When choosing a different theme, the preference dialog is immediately change to reflect the new setting. Only after the Apply button is clicked will the new theme be activated for all dialogs. See Theming in action! Default theme \u00b6 This is the Default theme Dark Theme \u00b6 This is the Dark theme Blue Theme \u00b6 This is the Blue theme Import / Export \u00b6 Exporting lets you save the content of the current collected set of form history items to a single (XML) file. Importing reads all form history items from an export file back into your collection. You can use the Export / Import as a backup mechanism, you can also use it to transfer your collection from one device to another. Import and export is available from the File submenu in the menu-bar of The main dialog . Export \u00b6 Open the Export dialog from the File submenu in the menu-bar of The main dialog . After the Export dialog is opened, the form history is immediately made available for export. Due to browser safety restrictions the file will not be saved automatically. If the formhistory store is not empty the dialog will display the number of fields it has prepared for export and show a clickable download link. In order to open or save the file click on the download link, the browser will then give you the option to either save or open the data. Instead of left-click you can also do a right-click and choose the option 'Save link as...' from the menu. See Exporting entries in action! Import \u00b6 Open the Import dialog from the File submenu in the menu-bar of The main dialog . Click the browse button and open a previously saved export file. XML-Files exported from older versions of Form History Control are supported. After choosing the file hit the Import button. Duplicate fields already present will not be imported. When the import succeeds, the dialog will display the amount of text-fields and editor-fields that have been imported (including duplicate fields). See Importing entries in action! View / Edit entries \u00b6 By double clicking on a formhistory item in the list or by choosing modify or add from the menu, a dialog will appear offering more details to either modify or add various aspects of a formhistory item. View entry \u00b6 Displays all aspects stored for a particular entry. Right-clicking will reveal a context-menu offering the option top either copy only the clean text from a value or the raw value including any markup information it may contain. Radio-boxes at the bottom make it possible to render a preview according to different formats like HTML, Markdown or Wiki. To close the preview deselect the current checked box. Edit entry \u00b6 Displays all aspects stored for a particular entry. Cnange any value you like, When multiple items are selected the edit dialog will initially display empty fields and only the count and dates can be changed. The title on top of the dialog will inform you that you are about to change multiple items at once. Show Fields on the current page \u00b6 The Show fields option discovers all form fields displayed on the current page and adds a label next to each field revealing more detailed info when clicked. This option acts like a toggle, invoke it again to remove the form field info labels.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Manual/manual/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Manual/manual/#why-you-might-need-this-plugin","text":"This plugin stores text from editor fields as you type, so you never have to loose your work when disaster strikes.
