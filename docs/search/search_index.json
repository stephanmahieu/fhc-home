It requires a Java runtime of at least version 1.8.\nYou can check if you already have a Java runtime installed by executing the following command from the commandline:\n\n\njava -version\n\n\n\nIf this command is not recognized you most likely have no Java runtime installed.\nYou can find instructions on how to download and install Java from \nhttp://java.com/nl/download/\n\nor use a package manager provided by your OS.\n\n\nDownload the export application\n\n\nDownload the java application fhcExport-1.0.0.jar from github here: \nfhcExport-1.0.0.jar\n .\n\n\nPut this file in any directory you like, then open a dosbox or a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file.\nStart the application from the commandline using the -jar option (see the Usage section).\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nExporting data from Firefox's internal formhistory store\n\n\nFrom the command-line you start this java application using the following command:\n\n\njava -jar fhcExport-1.0.0.jar\n\n\n\nThat should display a little help text because you have to add at least one parameter:\n\n\n-h,--help                show help.\n-o,--outputfile <arg>    optional, the path of the outputfile (default:formhistory.xml in current directory)\n-p,--profile-dir <arg>   required, the Firefox profile directory.\n\n\n\nThe application needs to know where to find the Firefox database so you have to provide the Firefox profile directory.\n\n\nHow to find the profile directory is described on this \nmozilla.org support page\n\n\nFor example the profile directory can be something like: \nC:\\Users\\John\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\jguiwjin.default\n if you have a Windows OS.\n\n\nIf you know the profile directory you can start the java application and try to export the formhistory data.\n\nExecute the application with your profile directory as parameter:\n\n\njava -jar fhcExport-1.0.0.jar -p C:\\Users\\John\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\jguiwjin.default\n\n\n\nIf everything runs smoothly you should see something like:\n\n\nStart formhistory export\n- profile directory: C:\\Users\\John\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\jguiwjin.default/\n- destination file : formhistory.xml\nchecking outputfile:        OK\nchecking profile directory: OK\nreading inputfields:        2230\nreading multilinefields:    441\nwriting data:               OK\n\n\n\nYou should now have an exportfile named formhistory.xml that you can use to import into the new add-on.\n\n\nThe 'reading multilinefields' step might fail, this is completely normal if you never used this add-on before.\nThe export will still contain the formhistory for all standard text inputfields Firefox normally stores in its internal database.\n\n\nImporting the formhistory xml file:\n\n\n\n\nopen the Form History Control add-on in Firefox (right-click on the Form History Control icon, choose the first menu item)\n\n\nFrom the dialog you just opened, choose File from the Menu on top, then choose Import: the import dialog will open\n\n\nLocate and select the formhistory.xml file you exported previously\n\n\nSelecting the xml exportfile will enable the Import button, click this button to start the actual Import",
