# Introduction

## Why you might need this plugin
This plugin displays all form data that has been saved by the web browser with options to filter the
data either by keyword, active page, active field or cleanup criteria. It is furthermore possible to
sort the data by parameter including form field name, value, date or popularity.

This plugin stores text from editor fields as you type, so you never have to loose your work when
disaster strikes. Recover your lost work after session timeouts, network failures, browser crashes,
power failures, and all other things that will destroy the hard work you just put into writing that
important email, essay or blog post.

This plugin lets you easily search the complete history and selectively delete all data you do not wish
to be stored for eternity.
