## Dialogs not showing content
There is an annoying bug in Firefox for Linux users which causes the popup window to come up
blank most of the time.

- bugzilla: [Bug 1425829](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425829) New popup window appears blank until right-click
- bugzilla: [Bug 1416505 ](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1416505) WebExtensions popup blank

Workaround is to right-click inside the window or resize it. Hopefully this bug will be fixed soon.
